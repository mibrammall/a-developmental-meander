# A Developmental Meander

This will be a set of tutorials for software development aimed at a beginner who wants to learn how the technology around them works, and has the enthusiasm and patience to do things the slow way.

We will begin with the perhaps the most familiar program on a device, the browser. We will begin with an overview of HTML to create basic web pages, and then move on to styling pages, before finishing with adding some basic interaction using Javascript.

The end goal is unclear, but the aim is to begin from the front and move from what we see on the monitor and work backwards from there. Whether we stick to this has yet to be seen.

This was written with a few people in mind, but it is of course free to anyone that may get use from it. If you like the contents and are able to get something from it, I am delighted. If you don't like the contents, you will get a full refund on the cost.
